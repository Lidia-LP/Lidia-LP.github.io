# Summary
This historical novel is structured around a dual time fictional account.
On the one hand, young Odile’s story starts in Paris in 1939. Shortly after getting her dream job at the American Library in Paris, the Nazis storm into the city and Odile’s privileged life quickly fades into just a memory. Her job at the library and her love for books become her only weapons when she joins the Resistance. However, her heroic story is finally sealed by unconceivable betrayal.

The second story follows Lily, and is set in Montana in 1983. Lily is lonely and struggles to fit in her small town. Her boredom is only relieved by the chance to get to know her mysterious neighbour. Slowly, her friendship with this otherwise solitary older lady, teaches her invaluable life lessons. This atypical couple is united by shared passions and a shared complicated emotional baggage. 

# My take on this book
This novel is based on a true World War 2 story of the heroic efforts of the librarians from the American Library in Paris. I have been passionate of historical fiction set in WW2 since elementary school, when I discovered Ana Frank’s diaries, and have read dozens of historical novels retelling Resistance stories. In fact, I have read so many that I stopped at some point, because it became difficult to find novelty in them. 

This story seemed to had it all to make a thrilling one and reignite my interest in WW2 historical fiction: real life librarians who become heroes, romance, friendship, family, and the power of books to helps us overcome and unite over the most difficult times. 
It was indeed the library setting that made the book special to me, and what motivated me to start reading. 

The best part of this book is that it retells real facts and in fact the authors’ note at the end was the most interesting bit to read. I really enjoyed understanding her inspirations for each character and learning about what the librarians from the American Library in Paris accomplished during WW2. It was really inspirational reading about how we can all become heroes in difficult times. This book was also a very timely reminder of the power of books to provide a place of solace when everything around seems daunting and out of control.

I also appreciated the constant references to the Dewey decimal system that we actually used in my school library. It was a great strategy to understand Odile’s personality; she used this system to classify not only bools but also people, feelings and memories. It helps her understand the world around her, and feel confident about her interpretations of events quickly unfurling.  

Similarly, I enjoyed passages, conversation and episodes that were replaced by book excerpts that conveyed exactly what was in the characters’ hearts and minds. This worked as a relief to lighten the story, for example when lovers wanted to have intimacy when being overheard by family members.

Also, it was nice to delve into some aspects of French culture from the eyes of a young American girl. Descriptions of mouthwatering biscuits, curious facts about the language… they would make anyone dream of Paris!

At times, this novel felt powerful, and the exploration of the consequences of our choices, whether in a mundane or in an extremely difficult and rare setting, was interesting. This novel shows that it is our relationships and our choices, including picking favourite books and authors!, that define our lives. Seemingly about heroism, the value of this novel lies for me in the exploration of topics like jealousy, redemption, and second chances. Reading I realised how universal these are, and how past experiences can teach us lessons that translate into very different settings. 

However, very often the whole felt unsatisfying to me. 
This is a heavily character driven novel. Sadly, I couldn’t get invested in most of the characters, and I only felt curious about the older Odile. The rest lacked of complexity or novelty, and this made the book overall incomplete for me. 

Other things I didn’t like so much in this novel were the romance stories and Lily’s teenager struggles. I was particularly disengaged from the love story between Odile and Paul and would have rather discover her relationship with her colleagues in the library who were also performing incredibly brave acts of resistance. On the other hand, I rushed through the chapters involving Lily and her family/ school issues to return to Paris and the library.

Maybe my biggest criticism to this book is about what it doesn’t have, and is paradoxically linked to the things to praise about it. 
I think that to understand and fully acknowledge how brave and the difference Odile and her fellow librarians made, more time should have been spent describing how tough life in Paris under Nazi occupation was. We do get some glimpses of it: Odile and her family experience hunger, there is mention of people fleeing and hiding and terrifying experiences are shared. I feel though that individual stories of hardship beyond Odile’s should have been further explored so that we could appreciate the relief provided by the acts of the librarians from the American Library in Paris. 
It would have also been helpful to follow for a little some of those who were helped in their hiding by the books brought by the librarians. Only then can the reader understand the impact of the librarians’ heroism and the true power of literature and stories. Without them, we can only believe those, because we have experiences of finding comfort in books ourselves or thanks to the final authors’ note. 

# My verdict
I wanted to love this book but it wasn’t more than an entertaining read at the end, and so was a bit disappointed overall.
Fans of historical fiction, passionates of French culture and book lovers will find some pleasure in reading The Paris Library.
