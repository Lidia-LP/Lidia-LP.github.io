> “*When somebody tells me I can’t do something, that’s when I do it!*” 
> – Gertrude Ederle

This is the quote I try to live by. I am determined and love exploring and learning new things.

I am obsessed with all things books (in English, French and Spanish)! 
My favourite genres include contemporary and historial fiction, thrillers and most recently, romance. I am a scientist (studied neuroscience and public health) and love the occasional non-fiction general science book.

Since 2018, I host a monthly book club with staff and students from my university. We alternate the topics (which have included first book of authors and translated works) and genres (historical fiction, contemporary fiction, non-fiction).

When not reading, you can find me drinking coffee, swimming, learning piano, attempting to cook and (if I am lucky) travelling.
